//Write a class Worker and derive classes DailyWorker and SalariedWorker from it. 
//Every worker has a name and a salary rate. Write method ComPay (int hours) to
//compute the week pay of every worker. A Daily Worker is paid on the basis 
//of the number of days he/she works. The Salaried Worker gets paid the wage for
//40 hours a week no matter what the actual hours are. Test this program to calculate
//the pay of workers. You are expected to use the concept of polymorphism to write this program.
